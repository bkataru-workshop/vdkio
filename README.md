A toolkit for building video streaming applications in Rust. The VDK provides a collection of modules for handling various video formats, codecs, and streaming protocols. It aims to provide a high-performance, flexible, and extensible framework for video processing and streaming, with a primary focus on RTSP to HLS conversion for web-based video streaming applications.

## Current State of the Project

### Fully Tested Implementations

These features have been thoroughly tested with live streams and are production-ready:

1. **Streaming Protocols:**
   - **RTSP:** Fully implemented and tested with live RTSP streams, including core operations, authentication, and SDP parsing.
   - **RTP:** Fully tested with live streams, implementing packet handling, sequence number management, and jitter buffer.
   - **RTCP:** Thoroughly tested with reception reports and error handling.

2. **Codec Support (via RTSP streams):**
   - **H.264:** Fully implemented and tested with live RTSP streams, including detailed handling of NALUs, SPS, and PPS.

### Preliminary and Planned Implementations

While live testing URLs are essential for full validation and production readiness, we provide preliminary implementations with basic unit tests for formats that currently lack live testing capabilities. This approach ensures:

1. **Basic Functionality:** Core features are implemented and unit tested
2. **Format Compatibility:** Basic compatibility with the format specifications
3. **Integration Readiness:** Groundwork for future live testing and validation
4. **Development Continuity:** Progress continues while awaiting live testing resources

**Note:** These implementations should be considered experimental until validated with live streams. They provide a foundation for testing and development but are not recommended for production use without comprehensive live testing.

1. **Format Support:**
   - **AAC Format:** Basic implementation of AAC file format support (muxer/demuxer) with unit tests only. Needs live stream testing and more comprehensive tests.
   - **TS Format:** Core TS format implementation is complete and used in RTSP to HLS conversion. Further testing needed with different codec combinations and transport stream variations.

### Critical Next Steps

1. **RTSP to HLS Conversion Enhancement:**
    - Implement robust error recovery for stream interruptions and network issues
    - Optimize TS segment generation and management for improved performance
    - Add comprehensive testing with varied RTSP streams and codec combinations
    - Enhance PCR timing accuracy and discontinuity handling
    - Implement advanced buffer management for smoother playback

2. **Performance Optimization:**
    - Profile and optimize TS muxing operations
    - Improve memory usage in segment management
    - Enhance concurrent stream handling efficiency
    - Optimize PCR timing calculations
    - Implement efficient segment cleanup strategies

3. **Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure:**
    - Develop automated testing framework for RTSP to HLS conversion
    - Create test suites for various network conditions
    - Implement stress testing for long-running streams
    - Add performance benchmarking tools

4. **Acquire Live Testing URLs**:
   - Obtain live testing URLs for the following formats to enable full feature validation, comprehensive testing, and ensure feature parity with the reference vdk implementation:
     - DVRIP
     - FLV
     - FMP4
     - MKV
     - MP4 variants
     - RTMP
     - WebRTC
