### Preliminary Implementations

The following features have preliminary implementations with basic unit tests. These implementations are functional but require thorough testing with live streams and more comprehensive tests for production use. 

**Note:** For formats listed under "Preliminary Implementations" and "Other Planned Implementations", live testing URLs are required for full validation and feature parity. Basic implementations and unit tests are provided, but comprehensive testing with live streams is essential for production readiness.

1. **Format Support:**
   - **AAC Format:** Basic implementation of AAC file format support (muxer/demuxer) with unit tests only. Needs live stream testing and more comprehensive tests.
   - **TS Format:** Core TS format implementation is complete and used in RTSP to HLS conversion. Further testing needed with different codec combinations and transport stream variations.

### Critical Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - **HLS Support:** Conduct more comprehensive testing with varied RTSP streams and codec combinations to ensure the robustness of HLS streaming and identify any potential issues.
   - **TS Format:** Perform thorough testing with diverse stream types and transport stream variations to fully validate TS format handling and error recovery.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling and Recovery:**
   - **HLS Support:** Implement more robust error recovery and handling mechanisms for HLS streaming to improve stability and reliability in real-world scenarios.
   - **TS Format:** Enhance error recovery mechanisms for TS format handling to ensure robust and fault-tolerant stream processing.

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - **General:** Identify and address any performance bottlenecks in TS muxing and HLS segmenting to optimize vdkio for high-performance video streaming applications.

4. **Acquire Live Testing URLs**:
   - Obtain live testing URLs for the following formats to enable full feature validation, comprehensive testing, and ensure feature parity with the reference vdk implementation:
     - DVRIP
     - FLV
     - FMP4
     - MKV
     - MP4 variants (MP4, MP4F, MP4M)
     - RTMP
     - WebRTC


### Other Planned Implementations

1. **DVRIP** - Preliminary implementation planned
2. **FLV** - Preliminary implementation planned
3. **FMP4** - Preliminary implementation planned
4. **MKV** - Preliminary implementation planned
